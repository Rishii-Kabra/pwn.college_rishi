# Challenge name
Reading input

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IA6oSogRuaADHVv5lHwr47bVBEu.QX4cTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we take input for PWN using the read command and also use the '-p' argument to promot for "INPUT: ". we give the input as COLLEGE and this sets the value of PWN as COLLEGE.

```bash
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT: " PWN
INPUT: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{IA6oSogRuaADHVv5lHwr47bVBEu.QX4cTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we can take input for a variable using the 'read' command. to give a prompt during the input we can use '-p' argument.
