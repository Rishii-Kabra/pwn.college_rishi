# Challenge name
Reading Files

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y7WIzq2exRQ-IK_TSdY94YB1ZCM.QXwIDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we redirect /challenge/read_me directly into the input for PWN variable (which is read PWN). The output is now stored in PWN.

```bash
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Y7WIzq2exRQ-IK_TSdY94YB1ZCM.QXwIDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we can use the 'read' command to read into a variable which directly takes its value from some other file by redirecting it. This removes the "Useless Use of Cat" by using the power of the shell
