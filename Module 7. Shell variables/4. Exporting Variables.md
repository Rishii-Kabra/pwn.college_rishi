# Challenge name
Exporting Variables

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0N5ze141dEcLkXrUr9o4MvVcmWI.QXyYTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we export the variable PWN by writing 'export PWN'. This will make it inherit by other commands we run and it not just local to the current shell process.

```bash
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ export PWN
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ COLLEGE=PWN
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ /challenge/run
CORRECT!
You have exported PWN=COLLEGE and set, but not exported, COLLEGE=PWN. Great
job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0N5ze141dEcLkXrUr9o4MvVcmWI.QXyYTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
```

## What i learned
variables that you set in a shell session are local to that shell process. it won't be inherited by other commands we run. to overcome this we can export variables by simply writing the export before the variable
