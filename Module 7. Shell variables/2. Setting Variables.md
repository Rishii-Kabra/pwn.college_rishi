# Challenge name
Setting Variables

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QbBIba9oPLitMnkMwOrS8UBgZG_.QX5UTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we set the value COLLEGE to variable PWN following the syntax leaving no gap between '='

```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{QbBIba9oPLitMnkMwOrS8UBgZG_.QX5UTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we can write values to variables as VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE. we cannot give space between '=' because then the shell will think of them as different commands. There is no need to prepend with '$' as that is only required to access variables.
