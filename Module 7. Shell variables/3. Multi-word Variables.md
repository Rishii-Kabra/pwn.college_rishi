# Challenge name
Multi-word Variables

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{A0S9MSXMA9VqvyWQLl1-hi4Bpj1.QXwYTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

We need to put space in our value so we quote it like this: "COLLEGE YEAH" . this will let the shell know that it is a single value and not treat it as two different commands

```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{A0S9MSXMA9VqvyWQLl1-hi4Bpj1.QXwYTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
To put space in our values, we need to quote the entire value. if we give space without quoting the entire value then the shell will treat it as different commands
