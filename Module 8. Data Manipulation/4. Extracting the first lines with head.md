# Extracting the first lines with head
extracting the first 7 lines using piping

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{I3yoDU9u3EK1kvh3whyBjIzrqgZ.0lNxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

we will pipe the first 7 line using head into /challenge/pwn and then pipe them onwards to /challenge/college

```bash
hacker@data~extracting-the-first-lines-with-head:~$ /challenge/pwn | head -n 7 | /challenge/college
Congratulations, you piped the right codes!
pwn.college{I3yoDU9u3EK1kvh3whyBjIzrqgZ.0lNxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we can use '-n' to get the first 10 lines of a big file and by providing a interger argument after the command will change the number of files output according to that integer
