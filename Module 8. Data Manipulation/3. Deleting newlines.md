# Deleting newlines
delete the newlines to get the flag

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QLVAjOkAKhc3qG9q8TKBZLJX4zf.0VNxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

we will delete the new lines by writing tr -d "\n". this will give us the output will all the newlines removed

```bash
hacker@data~deleting-newlines:~$ /challenge/run | tr -d "\n"
Your line-split flag: pwn.college{QLVAjOkAKhc3qG9q8TKBZLJX4zf.0VNxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
by specifying "\n" we can transpose the new lines into our desired result. In this particular challenge we used '-d' to delete the newlines.
