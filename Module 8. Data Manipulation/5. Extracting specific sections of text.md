# Extracting specific sections of text
extracting the first 7 lines using piping

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cRXTb7Zo2Zn6cwI3-jjqLfjqxko.01NxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

we create a single line solution using multiple pipes. we use cut to extract the flag characters as columns and then use the tr command to join them together into a single line using piping system.

```bash
hacker@data~extracting-specific-sections-of-text:~$ /challenge/run | cut -d " " -f 2 | tr -d "\n"
pwn.college{cRXTb7Zo2Zn6cwI3-jjqLfjqxko.01NxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we can use cut command to grab specific columns of data. the '-d' argument in cut command specifies how the column are seperated and '-f' argument specifies which column to extract
