# Deleting Characters
remove the decoy characters

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{smCcTEETcxT4z0ZdevSQu_RA3JW.0FNxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

with the use of tr -d we will remove the decoy characters. this will give us the output removing the decoys

```bash
hacker@data~deleting-characters:~$ /challenge/run | tr -d ^%
Your character-stuffed flag:
pwn.college{smCcTEETcxT4z0ZdevSQu_RA3JW.0FNxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
'tr -d' is used to delete characters, this essesntially translates the character to nothing(i.e., delete them)
