# Challenge name
Filtering with grep -v

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{APaRcJ_qynG2pCKCRTnfwbjnzvG.0FOxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

since the file contains thousand of decoys, we use the invert feature of grep to give us the line which does not contain the word DECOY ( grep -v )

```bash
hacker@piping~filtering-with-grep-v:~$ /challenge/run | grep -v DECOY
pwn.college{APaRcJ_qynG2pCKCRTnfwbjnzvG.0FOxEzNxwCN1gjNzEzW}}
```

## What i learned
grep has a very useful option -v (this inverts the matches), this means that it will return lines wiith do not match with the pattern
