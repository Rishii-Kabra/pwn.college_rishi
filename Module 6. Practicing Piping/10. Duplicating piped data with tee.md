# Challenge name
Duplicating piped data with tee

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gDiRVMXbNLrBhw2L6jCKFUqZX-b.QXxITO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use the tee comand to intercept the data flow and see what pwn need from us. once we find that out, we will update our pipes to give the required command to get our flag

```bash
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn | tee output_1 | /challenge/college
Processing...
The input to 'college' does not contain the correct secret code! This code
should be provided by the 'pwn' command. HINT: use 'tee' to intercept the
output of 'pwn' and figure out what the code needs to be.
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ cat output_1
Usage: /challenge/pwn --secret [SECRET_ARG]

SECRET_ARG should be "gDiRVMXb"
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn --secret gDiRVMXb | /challenge/college
Processing...
Correct! Passing secret value to /challenge/college...
Great job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gDiRVMXbNLrBhw2L6jCKFUqZX-b.QXxITO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we can use tee comand to duplicate data flowing through your pipes to any number of files. We can use it to inctercept the data flow to find out the error and debug
