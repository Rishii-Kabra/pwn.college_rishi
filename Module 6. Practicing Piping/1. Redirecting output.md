# Challenge name
Redirecting output

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{s8et1SuokCAMffIf-RzvpHMjREY.QX0YTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we create a file COLLEGE and redirect the word PWN to that file

```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{s8et1SuokCAMffIf-RzvpHMjREY.QX0YTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
