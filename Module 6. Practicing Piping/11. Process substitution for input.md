# Challenge name
Process substitution for input

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{81fWJrYHy9QtTRImSq2e_k2XmDq.0lNwMDOxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use the '<(command)' on both the files simultaneously and use the diff command to compare the output of both the files. This will give us the only diff which is the flag.

```bash
hacker@piping~process-substitution-for-input:~$ diff <(/challenge/print_decoys) <(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)
74a75
> pwn.college{81fWJrYHy9QtTRImSq2e_k2XmDq.0lNwMDOxwCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
linux treats everything like a file, including input and output. we can use '<(command)' which will hook up the command's output to a temporary file that it will create. This is called Process Substitution.
