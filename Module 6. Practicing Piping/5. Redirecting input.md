# Challenge name
Redirecting input

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MhaHrpHaCoEvcNuQmAkARIQo2NW.QXwcTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we first redirect COLLEGE to PWN using '>'. Then we use '<' to redirect PWN output to /challenge/run

```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MhaHrpHaCoEvcNuQmAkARIQo2NW.QXwcTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
using '<' we can redirect input to programs
