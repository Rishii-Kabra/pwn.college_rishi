# Writing to multiple programs
piping and t splitter

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MyKIwVjMHQhow-i3J6v0nCkvkX2.QXwgDN1wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we can solve this by combining the tee command with process substitution. This allows us to split the output stream from /challenge/hack and direct it to both of the other programs simultaneously

```bash
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) | /challenge/planet
Congratulations, you have duplicated data into the input of two programs! Here 
is your flag:
pwn.college{MyKIwVjMHQhow-i3J6v0nCkvkX2.QXwgDN1wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
Essentially, tee is acting like a T-splitter in a pipe, duplicating the data stream from /challenge/hack so it can flow to both /challenge/the and /challenge/planet at the same time
