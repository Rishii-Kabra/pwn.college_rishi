# Challenge name
Grepping stored results

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MhaHrpHaCoEvcNuQmAkARIQo2NW.QXwcTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we first redirect the output of /challenge/run to tmp/data.txt and then we grep for the term pwn.college ( since that is present in every flag) to get our flag

```bash
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ grep pwn.college /tmp/data.txt
pwn.college{IaesX09DsPjgVQ4ODqxRd5UonzE.QX4EDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
in this challenge i learned to use multiple commands in a single program and with the help of that grapping out a stored result
