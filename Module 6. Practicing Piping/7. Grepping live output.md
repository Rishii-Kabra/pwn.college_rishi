# Grepping live output
piping

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ECsGTuc8kpSZfS15WWqrFx7s6RA.QX5EDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use the pipe operator, we keep our file in the left side of pipe and grep command on the right side of pipe

```bash
hacker@piping~grepping-live-output:~$ /challenge/run | grep pwn.college
pwn.college{ECsGTuc8kpSZfS15WWqrFx7s6RA.QX5EDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
In pipe operator, Standard output from the command to the left of the pipe will be connected to (piped into) the standard input of the command to the right of the pipele
