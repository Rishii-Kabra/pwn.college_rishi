# Starting Background Processes
'&' command

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wAQeYMAvUe4pxZ3kLcXzNaEx-YK.QX5QDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we append '&' with the run file to direcly make it run in the background

```bash
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
[1] 149
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ 


Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

Anyways! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{wAQeYMAvUe4pxZ3kLcXzNaEx-YK.QX5QDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we can direcly run a process in the background by appending '&' with the command
