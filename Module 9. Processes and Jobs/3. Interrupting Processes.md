# Interrupting Processes
use ctrl C

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gwcIJRNJEqGLTGRccY1EywHIzjj.QXzQDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use ctrl C to force exit the process which started

```bash
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gwcIJRNJEqGLTGRccY1EywHIzjj.QXzQDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
ctrl C interrupts whatever application is waiting on input from the terminal and typically causes the application to exit.
