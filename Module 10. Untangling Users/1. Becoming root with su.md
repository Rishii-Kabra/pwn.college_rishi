# Becoming root with su
'su and sudo' command

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IMVgssVVk3yjwCDJKUN09Q8Xcvd.QX1UDN1wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use the su command to become the root. we give the password and then run the flag file to get our flag file

```bash
hacker@users~becoming-root-with-su:~$ su
Password: 
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# cat /flag
pwn.college{IMVgssVVk3yjwCDJKUN09Q8Xcvd.QX1UDN1wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
'su and sudo' commands are used to become the root of the system and gain administrative power
