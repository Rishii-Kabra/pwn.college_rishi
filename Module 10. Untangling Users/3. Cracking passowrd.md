The objective was to gain access to the user account zardus and run the /challenge/run program to get a flag. To do this, we were given a leaked shadow file located at /challenge/shadow-leak, which contained the encrypted (hashed) password for zardus. Using the John the Ripper password cracking tool, we successfully analyzed this file and cracked the hash

```bash
hacker@users~cracking-passwords:~$ john /challenge/shadow-leak
Loaded 1 password hash (crypt, generic crypt(3) [?/64])
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
aardvark         (zardus)
1g 0:00:00:20 100% 2/3 0.04823g/s 280.8p/s 280.8c/s 280.8C/s Johnson..buzz
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
hacker@users~cracking-passwords:~$ john --show /challenge/shadow-leak
