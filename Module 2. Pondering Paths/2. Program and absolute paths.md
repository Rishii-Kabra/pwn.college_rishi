# Program and absolute paths
the root '/'

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0LiKc7IaNfy8TpmbwrJGEZqZOMV.QX1QTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use the absolute path of run as '/challenge/run'

```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0LiKc7IaNfy8TpmbwrJGEZqZOMV.QX1QTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
the run file was inside the challenge and it teached the basics about file structure and path wrting
