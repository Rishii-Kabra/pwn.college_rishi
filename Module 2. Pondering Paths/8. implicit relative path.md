# implicit relative path
go to a certain path

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AFkYivd_dlDwAlhQg4Ft3swQiRJ.QXwUTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use cd to go to '/challenge' and then use '.' to specify the same path and run './run'

```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Q2yX_SWOeVzXR2DdlZmWQ7RRo_m.QXxUTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
In most operating systems, including Linux, every directory has two implicit entries that you can reference in paths: . and ... The first, ., refers right to the same directory.
