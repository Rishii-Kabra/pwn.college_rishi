# home sweet home
make use of '~'

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IJjPSHOQyajG9XtLJDj9joZT7aK.QXzMDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we make the use '~' to match our constrain of limiting the argument to three character or less.

```bash
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/a
Writing the file to /home/hacker/a!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{IJjPSHOQyajG9XtLJDj9joZT7aK.QXzMDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
the expansion of '~' is an absolute path and only the leading '~' is expanded
