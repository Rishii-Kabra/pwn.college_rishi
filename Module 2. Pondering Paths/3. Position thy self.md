# Position thy self
go to a certain path

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Yi2aSUhGlOFH-PW_uYusAeA-qH2.QX2QTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use cd to go to the specified path and then run our '/challenge/run' from there

```bash
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Yi2aSUhGlOFH-PW_uYusAeA-qH2.QX2QTN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we learned that '~' shows the current paths that your shell is located at. we can use cd to change the current directory to our desired path.
