# The Root
the root '/'

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oZtVsh0A7Zg9HxN6IAMu6O4gsSD.QX4cTO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we invoke pwn using its absolute path

```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{oZtVsh0A7Zg9HxN6IAMu6O4gsSD.QX4cTO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
the filesystem stars at '/'. in this we were told to invoke pwn using its absolute file path therefore we include '/'
