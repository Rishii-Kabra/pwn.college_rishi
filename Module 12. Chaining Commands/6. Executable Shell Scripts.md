we use The shebang, without it the system wont konw it should be run with bash. we give executable permission and run the script through its path

```bash
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > run_solve.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ echo '/challenge/solve' >> run_solve.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ chmod +x run_solve.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ ./run_solve.sh
Congratulations on your shell script execution! Your flag:
