# Scripting with Conditionals
script conditions

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kHR0S_S7n1m4_7TDvBHqD-1ey8y.0lNzMDOxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use if to check for pwn and print college if condition is met

```bash
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ echo 'if [ "$1" == "pwn" ]' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ echo 'then' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ echo '    echo "college"' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ echo 'fi' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ bash ~/solve.sh pwn
college
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ /challenge/run
Correct! Your script properly handles all the conditions.
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{kHR0S_S7n1m4_7TDvBHqD-1ey8y.0lNzMDOxwCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we can use if statements but they have to have proper syntax and proper spacing. the if command ends with fi
