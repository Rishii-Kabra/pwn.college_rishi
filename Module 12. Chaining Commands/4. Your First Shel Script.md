# Your First Shel Script
chaining commands

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EjmFhHqNMLnB0DxpFN15jAuMgzF.QXxcDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use '||' to chain the commands

```bash
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo "/challenge/pwn; /challenge/college" > x && bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{EjmFhHqNMLnB0DxpFN15jAuMgzF.QXxcDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
by convention, shell scripts are frequently named with a sh suffix. And then we can execute by passing it as an argument to a new instance of our shell (bash)! When a shell is invoked like this, rather than taking commands from the user, it reads commands from the file.
