# Redirecting Script Output
chaining commands

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sNXx4ApigfKZqy2BVCxIaI-4f6G.QX4ETO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we'll group the commands together and pipe their combined output directly to the solve command

```bash
hacker@chaining~redirecting-script-output:~$ { /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college; } | /challenge/solve; 
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sNXx4ApigfKZqy2BVCxIaI-4f6G.QX4ETO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
All of the various redirection methods work: > for stdout, 2> for stderr, < for stdin, >> and 2>> for append-mode redirection, >& for redirecting to other file descriptors, and | for piping to another command
