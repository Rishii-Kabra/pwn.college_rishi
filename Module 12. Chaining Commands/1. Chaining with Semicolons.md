# Chaining with Semicolons
chaining commands

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AqZH_AmCqnuh6QpxRdad4huMVdW.QX1UDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use semicolon to chain the commands

```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn ; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AqZH_AmCqnuh6QpxRdad4huMVdW.QX1UDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
Basically, when we hit Enter, shell executes our typed command and, after that command terminates, gives us the prompt to input another command. The semicolon is analogous, just without the prompt and with us entering both commands before anything is executed
