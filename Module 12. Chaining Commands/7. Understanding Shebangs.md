we use shebhang to let the shell know its a bash file 

```bash
hacker@chaining~understanding-shebangs:~$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~understanding-shebangs:~$ echo "echo 'hack the planet'" >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~understanding-shebangs:~$ chmod +x /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~understanding-shebangs:~$ /challenge/run
Testing your script...

## What i learned
There are a bunch of different types of programs, but if the program file starts with the characters #! (often termed a "shebang"), Linux treats the file as an interpreted program, and the contents of the rest of the line as the path to the interpreter. It then invokes the interpreter with the path to the program file as its only argument.
