# Handling Failure
chaining commands

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gclSCCV9TltgzqjTy7QcDcwblcP.01M0MDOxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use '||' to chain the commands

```bash
hacker@chaining~handling-failure:~$ /challenge/first-failure || /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{gclSCCV9TltgzqjTy7QcDcwblcP.01M0MDOxwCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
the || operator allows you to run a second command only if the first command fails (exits with a non-zero code)
