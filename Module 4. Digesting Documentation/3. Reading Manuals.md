# Challenge name
Reading Manuals

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{k_1Jb-ABq-0OfyibGEfNxtwY9x5.QX0EDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

using man challenge we get the list of all the command you pass as an argument. from there we get to know the specific command needed to print the flag. we get out by pressing 'q' and write the command necessary and get the desired result

```bash
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --kbqfyi 109
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{k_1Jb-ABq-0OfyibGEfNxtwY9x5.QX0EDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
Learned about the man command. man is the short form of manual, and will display (if available) the manual of the command you pass as an argument in a detailed manner
