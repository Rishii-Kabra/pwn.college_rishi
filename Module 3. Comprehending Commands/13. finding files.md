# finding files
use of find command

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{76aHyjUISVpvZYRLYUWz667awr-u.QXxMDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use find command to find all the files with the name of flag and then get our flag by trial and error

```bash
hacker@commands~finding-files:~$ find / -name flag
```

## What i learned
we can use the command find to find all the files with a specified keyword. we need to pass the desired name in the arguments of the function
