# comparing files
use diff command to find the flag

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cCkvV5TZWsdkxpu0YlRkQiac_d9.01MwMDOxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

we'll use diff command to get our flag and ignore all the fake flags since they are comman in both the files.

```bash
hacker@commands~comparing-files:~$ diff /challenge/decoys_only.txt /challenge/decoys_and_real.txt
98a99
> pwn.college{cCkvV5TZWsdkxpu0YlRkQiac_d9.01MwMDOxwCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
diff command compares two files line by line and shows us the difference between them.
