# touching files
use touch command

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{E9M_-hCWNukA1aUxTHeov-a1E7I.QXwMDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use the touch command to make two new files which are pwn and college. then we run '/challenge/run' to get our flag

```bash
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ touch pwn
hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ touch college
hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{E9M_-hCWNukA1aUxTHeov-a1E7I.QXwMDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
