# Executable Files
chmod command

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sMmDC5DhoQ8vhmNo_zEcKJdY0E1.QXyEjN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use the change mode command with argument 'a+x /challenge/run' which says allow the file to be executed by everyone

```bash
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod a+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sMmDC5DhoQ8vhmNo_zEcKJdY0E1.QXyEjN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
first character there is the file type. next three characters are user persmission. next three characters are the grp persmissions. next three characters are all other access permissions. (example: drwxr-xr-x)
r - user/group/other can read the file (or list the directory)
w - user/group/other can modify the files (or create/delete files in the directory)
x - user/group/other can execute the file as a program (or can enter the directory, e.g., using `cd`)
'-' nothing 
chmod (chamege mode) command is used to change persmission 
chmod [OPTIONS] MODE FILE
