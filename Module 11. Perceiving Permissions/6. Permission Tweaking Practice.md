You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod a+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag

## What i learned
first character there is the file type. next three characters are user persmission. next three characters are the grp persmissions. next three characters are all other access permissions. (example: drwxr-xr-x)
r - user/group/other can read the file (or list the directory)
w - user/group/other can modify the files (or create/delete files in the directory)
x - user/group/other can execute the file as a program (or can enter the directory, e.g., using `cd`)
'-' nothing 
chmod (chamege mode) command is used to change persmission 
chmod [OPTIONS] MODE FILE
