# Permission Tweaking Practice
chmod command

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q9TeHaJIwTtg6WPBwPlgBwwudBs.QXzETO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

You set the correct permissions!
You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod a+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{Q9TeHaJIwTtg6WPBwPlgBwwudBs.QXzETO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
we can chain commands with comma. Additionally, you can zero out permissions with '-'.
example: 
chmod u=rw,g=r,o=- /challenge/pwn will set the user permissions to read and write, the group permissions to read-only, and the world permissions to nothing at all
