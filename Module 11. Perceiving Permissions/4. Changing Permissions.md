# Changing Permissions
chmod command

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4TTvqZBHOy-e28VqHAk3sH8tzIz.QXzcjM1wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use the change mode command with argument 'a+r /flag' which says allow flag file read to everyone

```bash
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ chmod a+r /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{4TTvqZBHOy-e28VqHAk3sH8tzIz.QXzcjM1wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
first character there is the file type. next three characters are user persmission. next three characters are the grp persmissions. next three characters are all other access permissions. (example: drwxr-xr-x)
r - user/group/other can read the file (or list the directory)
w - user/group/other can modify the files (or create/delete files in the directory)
x - user/group/other can execute the file as a program (or can enter the directory, e.g., using `cd`)
'-' nothing 
chmod (chamege mode) command is used to change persmission 
chmod [OPTIONS] MODE FILE
