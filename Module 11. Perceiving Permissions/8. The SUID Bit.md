# The SUID Bit
setting SUID permission

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Icsjnb9wQo24xWOr1GXqi2o8KoC.QXzEjN0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

By adding the SUID bit using chmod u+s, you are telling the system: Anyone who runs this program should temporarily become the file's owner (root) while the program is running. When you execute it, you get a shell that is running with root privileges, allowing you to access and read any file on the system, including the flag.

```bash
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ /challenge/getroot
SUCCESS! You have set the suid bit on this program, and it is running as root! 
Here is your shell...
root@permissions~the-suid-bit:~# cat /flag
pwn.college{Icsjnb9wQo24xWOr1GXqi2o8KoC.QXzEjN0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
The SUID (Set User ID) bit is a special file permission in Linux. When an executable file with the SUID bit set is run, the process will execute with the permissions of the file owner, not the user who ran it
