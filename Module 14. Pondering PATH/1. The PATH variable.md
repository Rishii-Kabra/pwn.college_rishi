# The PATH variable
use of PATH variable

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Iyl4c1ksC0DJ5bm1QkNZePWrAuJ.QX2cDM1wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we clear the path variable by assigning it to null. with the path cleared, the challenge program will be unable to locate rm and fail to delete

```bash
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ export PATH=""
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ ls
bash: ls: No such file or directory
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
/challenge/run: line 4: rm: No such file or directory
The flag is still there! I might as well give it to you!
pwn.college{Iyl4c1ksC0DJ5bm1QkNZePWrAuJ.QX2cDM1wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
PATH is a shell variable that stores a bunch of directory paths in which the shell will search for the programs corresponding to commands
