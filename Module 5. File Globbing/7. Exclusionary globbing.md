# Exclusionary globbing
excluding characters

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cmBlQqLskYwUw0jOUPPXexm0oPI.QX2IDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use '!' which inverts the search, basically meaning it will return all the file which do not have the specified charaters, in this case, 'pwn'

```bash
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ cd /challenge/files && /challenge/run [!pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{cmBlQqLskYwUw0jOUPPXexm0oPI.QX2IDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
 If the first character in the brackets is a '!' or a '^', the glob inverts, and that bracket instance matches characters that aren't listed.
