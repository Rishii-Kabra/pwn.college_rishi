# Challenge name
Multiple Globs

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gGs1WJHb6kjyo_UDSZdoatP5MdO.0lM3kjNxwCN1gjNzEzW}`

since * makes the shell look for anything similar or nothing, we use *p* to make it look for any word that contains a p in it. the * in the front and back will cover anything that has p in it.

```bash
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{gGs1WJHb6kjyo_UDSZdoatP5MdO.0lM3kjNxwCN1gjNzEzW}
```
