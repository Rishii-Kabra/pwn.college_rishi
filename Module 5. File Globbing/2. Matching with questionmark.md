# Challenge name
Matching with ?

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kxXeV3hO7azf2RqP2fbDgc9Ex26.QXyIDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use ? to complete the word challenge with just writing ?ha??enge since ? is a single character wildcard which matches with only one character

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c0Ut-e7l8Q72c0pWGK-y8HvHdW8.QXxIDO0wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
? is similar to * but only matches with one character. the shell treats it as a wildcard for one character.
