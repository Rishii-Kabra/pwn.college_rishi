# Intro to arguments
write the hello command with arguments

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QEBIUq20-1SwiJX04pRIa7qe30V.QX4YjM1wCN1gjNzEzW}`

we use the hello command with the hacker argument to get our flag

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QEBIUq20-1SwiJX04pRIa7qe30V.QX4YjM1wCN1gjNzEzW}
```

## What i learned
When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell reads your input into a command and its arguments. The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments. There can be multiplae arguemnts
